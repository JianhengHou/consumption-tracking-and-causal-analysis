## Background
### Mission
Our research team in the company has always been working around behavior chages of people. Such research help us have a better understanding of consumers' behavior shift and investment inspiration and implication behind the change. The earlier we catch those interesting signals, the less type II error in venture decision making we would cause. Good insights includes what sectors are trending differently and what caused that change.

## Problem Statement
Given the datastream and all related themes, we would want to leverage this data to identify early signals among various consumption sectors, unfold demographic factors correlated the change the most, and see how much so called constructual and behavioral contribution each segment makes to the change.
